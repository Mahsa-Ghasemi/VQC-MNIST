# Descripstion
In this implementation, we have built a quantum machine learning algorithm that recognizes and classifies handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset. For the sake of simplicity in this implementation, we target only to digits: 0 and 1. We will make use of several dimensional reduction techniques, perform classical pre-processing and initialise our own quantum feature maps.
